<p class="justify">
Thank you for the opporunity to apply for the position of web developer for the Regional Mining Company. Please feast your eyes on each of the other pages by using the navigational bar above and the four other page options; Resume, Relevant Skills Newsletter Signup Form and the About page. The Relevant Skills has a dropdown sub-menu that displays four skills that I possess, Web Development Skills, Creative, Technical and Problem Solving Skills. These skills will complement the job suitably.
</p>
<p class="justify">
In the Resume Page you will find examples of ordered and unordered lists as well as a table. There are even external links to webpages! To go to the resume page, click on the internal resume link in the navigation bar at the bottom of the header. The resume page includes another exmaple of an internal link, to the Web Skills Page!
</p>
	
<p class="justify">
In the Webskills page you will see an example of a descriptive list. There is also an internal link to the Newsletter Form that opens in a new tab.	
</p>

<p class="justify">
The Newsletter Signup Form uses an external Javascript form to create user interactivity and post what is entered to a designated server address. It has validation by using maximum character limits, and required fields.
</p>

<p class="justify">
In the About page, are my contact details, and an included headshot. The contact details use the address html feature, and includes a hyperlink to my email address which you can click on.<br>&nbsp;
</p>
	
<p class="centre">
I hope you enjoy the Personal Portfolio Webpage!
